A Sudoku Game texted base game with visual texts to represent a Sudoku Board

It generates a Sudoku Game from a 3 by 3 grid to 9 by 9 grid using an algorithm I created.

It plays by asking questions of what the next move is for the player.

The game ends when the grid is completely filled with numbers.
